8bc -- B compiler for the PDP-8

8bc is a B compiler for the PDP-8.  It compiles standard B for the
PDP-8/E or later computers with or without an EAE.  Programs are
compiled to BIN formatted tapes with an entry point at 0200.

To build 8bc, first edit Makefile according to your system's needs.
Typically, nothing needs to be adjusted.  You need the following
prerequisites:

 * an ANSI C compiler
 * lex (e.g. flex) with libl.a
 * yacc (e.g. bison) with liby.a
 * groff

Then type

    make all

to compile 8bc and

    make install

to install the distribution.  You may need to manually update the manual
database afterwards.  If you are a maintainer, read Makefile carefully
for instructions.
