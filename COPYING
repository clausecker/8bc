The pal assembler is distributed under the following terms:

   author:  Douglas Jones <jones@cs.uiowa.edu> -- built basic bits
            Rich Coon <coon@convexw.convex.com> -- added enough handle OS/278
            Bernhard Baehr <b.baehr@madsack.de> -- patch to correct checksum

   copyright notice:  I wrote this and gave it away for free; if you want to
	make changes and give away the result for free, that's fine with me.
	If you can fix it enough that you can sell it, ok, but don't put any
	limits on the purchaser's right to do the same.  All the above aside,
	if you improve it or fix any bugs, it would be nice if you told me
	and offered me a copy of the new version.
